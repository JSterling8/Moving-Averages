The Plan:


Write tests before each step!

[0] Improve accuracy by changing floats to decimals
[1] Implement a custom binary search of the dataset
[2] Make sure code documentation is thorough and up to date
[3] Implement SMA without interpolation or extrapolation
[4] Add interpolation
[5] Add extrapolation
[6] Add flags to let user decide whether or not to interpolate and/or extrapolate
[7] Make sure code documentation is thorough and up to date
